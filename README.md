# IaC Day 1 - Extra Credit

Can you turn this repo into a completely automated process

1. Generate a basic IaC pipeline with your CI/CD tool of choice
2. Take it to the next level and spin out the S3 objects into their own workspace that can be update independently
3. Use a loop to create set of different websites that use a seperate workspace as purely a data source
